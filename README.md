# hello-world
Just following instructions!

Still following instructions!

Now, I've added a line using Visual Studio Code after cloning to my hard drive.

OK, here's another line.

And, another!

This line is being added in a second local branch.

That one didn't show up locally?

Going for it again!

Repeat going again
